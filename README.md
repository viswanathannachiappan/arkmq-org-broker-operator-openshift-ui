# ArkMQ Broker Operator OpenShift UI

OpenShift Console plugin for the ArkMQ Broker Operator. It extends the admin perspective with workflows for provisioning messaging infrastructure and connecting applications to brokers. It requires OpenShift 4.22 or higher.

[Dynamic plugins](https://github.com/openshift/console/tree/master/frontend/packages/console-dynamic-plugin-sdk)
allow you to extend the
[OpenShift UI](https://github.com/openshift/console)
at runtime, adding custom pages and other extensions. They are based on
[webpack module federation](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/module-federation/).
Plugins are registered with console using the `ConsolePlugin` custom resource
and enabled in the console operator config by a cluster administrator.

Using the latest `v1` API version of `ConsolePlugin` CRD requires OpenShift 4.12
and higher. For the older `v1alpha1` API version, use OpenShift 4.10 or 4.11.

For examples targeting older OpenShift versions, see the upstream
[OpenShift Console Plugin Template](https://github.com/openshift/console-plugin-template)
`release-4.11` and `release-4.10` branches.

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) are required
to build and run the plugin. To run OpenShift console in a container, either
[Docker](https://www.docker.com) or [podman 3.2.0+](https://podman.io) and
[oc](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/downloads) are required.

## Getting started

The plugin adds BrokerService and BrokerApp pages in the **Workloads** navigation
section. Extensions are declared in
[console-extensions.json](console-extensions.json), and React components live under
[src/brokerapps](src/brokerapps) and [src/brokerservices](src/brokerservices).

You can run the plugin using a local development environment or build an image
to deploy it to a cluster.

## Development

### Option 1: Local

In one terminal window, run:

1. `yarn install`
2. `yarn run start`

In another terminal window, run:

1. `oc login` (requires [oc](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/downloads) and an [OpenShift cluster](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/create))
2. `cd ./bridge-auth-http/ && ./setup.sh && cd ..`
3. `yarn run start-console` (requires [Docker](https://www.docker.com) or [podman 3.2.0+](https://podman.io))

This will run the OpenShift console in a container connected to the cluster
you've logged into. The plugin HTTP server runs on port 9001 with CORS enabled.
Navigate to <http://localhost:9000> to see the running plugin.

To view our plugin on OpenShift, navigate to the Workloads section. The plugin will be listed as BrokerServices and BrokerApps.

#### Running start-console with Apple silicon and podman

If you are using podman on a Mac with Apple silicon, `yarn run start-console`
might fail since it runs an amd64 image. You can workaround the problem with
[qemu-user-static](https://github.com/multiarch/qemu-user-static) by running
these commands:

```bash
podman machine ssh
sudo -i
rpm-ostree install qemu-user-static
systemctl reboot
```

### Option 2: Docker + VSCode Remote Container

Make sure the
[Remote Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
extension is installed. This method uses Docker Compose where one container is
the OpenShift console and the second container is the plugin. It requires that
you have access to an existing OpenShift cluster. After the initial build, the
cached containers will help you start developing in seconds.

1. Create a `dev.env` file inside the `.devcontainer` folder with the correct values for your cluster:

```bash
OC_PLUGIN_NAME=arkmq-org-broker-operator-openshift-ui
OC_URL=https://api.example.com:6443
OC_USER=kubeadmin
OC_PASS=<password>
```

2. `(Ctrl+Shift+P) => Remote Containers: Open Folder in Container...`
3. `yarn run start`
4. Navigate to <http://localhost:9000>

## Docker image

Before you can deploy your plugin on a cluster, you must build an image and
push it to an image registry.

1. Build the image:

   ```sh
   docker build -t quay.io/my-repository/my-plugin:latest .
   ```

2. Run the image:

   ```sh
   docker run -it --rm -d -p 9001:80 quay.io/my-repository/my-plugin:latest
   ```

3. Push the image:

   ```sh
   docker push quay.io/my-repository/my-plugin:latest
   ```

NOTE: If you have a Mac with Apple silicon, you will need to add the flag
`--platform=linux/amd64` when building the image to target the correct platform
to run in-cluster.

## Deployment on cluster

A [Helm](https://helm.sh) chart is available to deploy the plugin to an OpenShift environment.

The following Helm parameters are required:

`plugin.image`: The location of the image containing the plugin that was previously pushed

Additional parameters can be specified if desired. Consult the chart [values](charts/openshift-console-plugin/values.yaml) file for the full set of supported parameters.

### Installing the Helm Chart

Install the chart using the name of the plugin as the Helm release name into a
new namespace or an existing namespace, providing the location of the image
within the `plugin.image` parameter:

```shell
helm upgrade -i  my-plugin charts/openshift-console-plugin -n my-namespace --create-namespace --set plugin.image=my-plugin-image-location
```
+
NOTE: When deploying on OpenShift 4.10, it is recommended to add the parameter `--set plugin.securityContext.enabled=false` which will omit configurations related to Pod Security.

NOTE: When defining i18n namespace, adhere `plugin__<name-of-the-plugin>` format. The name of the plugin should be extracted from the `consolePlugin` declaration within the [package.json](package.json) file.

## i18n

The plugin template demonstrates how you can translate messages in with [react-i18next](https://react.i18next.com/). The i18n namespace must match
the name of the `ConsolePlugin` resource with the `plugin__` prefix to avoid
naming conflicts. For example, this plugin uses the
`plugin__arkmq-org-broker-operator-openshift-ui` namespace. You can use the `useTranslation` hook
with this namespace as follows:

```tsx
const Header: React.FC = () => {
  const { t } = useTranslation('plugin__arkmq-org-broker-operator-openshift-ui');
  return <h1>{t('Hello, World!')}</h1>;
};
```

For labels in `console-extensions.json`, you can use the format
`%plugin__arkmq-org-broker-operator-openshift-ui~My Label%`. Console will replace the value with
the message for the current language from the `plugin__arkmq-org-broker-operator-openshift-ui`
namespace. For example:

```json
  {
    "type": "console.navigation/section",
    "properties": {
      "id": "admin-demo-section",
      "perspective": "admin",
      "name": "%plugin__arkmq-org-broker-operator-openshift-ui~Plugin Template%"
    }
  }
```

Running `yarn i18n` updates the JSON files in the `locales` folder when adding
or changing messages.

## Certificate Management for BrokerService and BrokerApp

This project includes a certificate management script for setting up the required PKI infrastructure
to deploy BrokerService and BrokerApp resources.

### Prerequisites

Before using the certificate management script, ensure you have:

- `kubectl` configured and connected to your cluster
- `cert-manager` installed in your cluster
- `trust-manager` installed in your cluster (with `secretTargets.enabled=true`)
- Appropriate permissions to create cluster-wide resources
- The ArkMQ operator installed in your cluster

#### Installing the ArkMQ Operator

Install the operator using Helm:

```bash
helm install my-arkmq-org-broker-operator \
  oci://quay.io/arkmq-org/helm-charts/arkmq-org-broker-operator \
  --version 0.0.0-dev.latest
```

#### Installing cert-manager

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.15.1/cert-manager.yaml
kubectl wait deployment --for=condition=Available -n cert-manager --timeout=600s \
  cert-manager cert-manager-cainjector cert-manager-webhook
```

#### Installing trust-manager

```bash
helm repo add jetstack https://charts.jetstack.io --force-update
helm upgrade trust-manager jetstack/trust-manager --install \
  --namespace cert-manager \
  --set secretTargets.enabled=true \
  --set secretTargets.authorizedSecretsAll=true \
  --wait
```

### Quick Start

1. **Setup PKI Infrastructure** (one-time setup):

   ```bash
   yarn chain-of-trust setup
   ```

   This creates:
   - Self-signed root ClusterIssuer and CA certificate
   - CA-signed ClusterIssuer for issuing broker certificates
   - Trust bundle that distributes the CA to all namespaces
   - Operator certificate in the operator's namespace

2. **Create BrokerService Certificate**:

   ```bash
   yarn chain-of-trust create-service-cert --name messaging-service --namespace my-namespace
   ```

   This creates a certificate with the correct DNS names for the BrokerService.

3. **Create BrokerApp Certificate**:

   ```bash
   yarn chain-of-trust create-app-cert --name first-app --namespace my-namespace
   ```

   This creates a certificate for the BrokerApp to authenticate with the service.

4. **Cleanup** (removes all PKI resources):

   ```bash
   yarn chain-of-trust cleanup
   ```

### Usage Examples

**Setup with explicit namespace:**
```bash
yarn chain-of-trust setup --namespace my-operator-namespace
```

**Create certificates in different namespaces:**
```bash
# Service in namespace X
yarn chain-of-trust create-service-cert --name messaging-service --namespace service-namespace

# App in namespace Y
yarn chain-of-trust create-app-cert --name first-app --namespace app-namespace
```

**Get help:**
```bash
yarn chain-of-trust --help
```

### What Gets Created

The `setup` command creates:
- `ClusterIssuer/root-issuer` - Self-signed root issuer
- `Certificate/root-cert` (in cert-manager namespace) - Root CA certificate
- `ClusterIssuer/broker-ca-issuer` - CA issuer for signing broker certificates
- `Bundle/arkmq-org-broker-manager-ca` - Trust bundle distributed to all namespaces
- `Certificate/arkmq-org-broker-manager-cert` - Operator certificate

The `create-service-cert` command creates:
- `Certificate/<service-name>-broker-cert` - Service certificate with proper DNS names
- `Secret/<service-name>-broker-cert` - Secret containing the certificate

The `create-app-cert` command creates:
- `Certificate/<app-name>-app-cert` - App certificate
- `Secret/<app-name>-app-cert` - Secret containing the certificate

## Linting

This project adds prettier, eslint, and stylelint. Linting can be run with
`yarn run lint`.

The stylelint config disallows hex colors since these cause problems with dark
mode (starting in OpenShift console 4.11). You should use the
[PatternFly global CSS variables](https://patternfly-react-main.surge.sh/developer-resources/global-css-variables#global-css-variables)
for colors instead.

The stylelint config also disallows naked element selectors like `table` and
`.pf-` or `.co-` prefixed classes. This prevents plugins from accidentally
overwriting default console styles, breaking the layout of existing pages. The
best practice is to prefix your CSS classnames with your plugin name to avoid
conflicts. Please don't disable these rules without understanding how they can
break console styles!

## Prometheus Monitoring

This project includes scripts to manage Prometheus user workload monitoring and secure metrics scraping with mTLS authentication.

### Enabling User Workload Monitoring

**Enable user workload monitoring:**

```bash
yarn prometheus-config enable
```

Applies the `cluster-monitoring-config` ConfigMap to enable user workload monitoring.

**Verify monitoring setup:**

```bash
yarn prometheus-config verify
```

Waits for the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` namespace to exist and for all monitoring pods to be ready.

**Disable monitoring (cleanup):**

```bash
yarn prometheus-config disable
```

Removes the `cluster-monitoring-config` ConfigMap to disable user workload monitoring.

### Secure Metrics Scraping with mTLS

For locked-down brokers that require mutual TLS authentication, you can set up secure metrics scraping:

**1. Create Prometheus Certificate:**

First, create a Prometheus client certificate using the PKI infrastructure:

```bash
yarn chain-of-trust create-prometheus-cert --namespace my-namespace
```

This creates a `prometheus-cert` secret with CN=prometheus that Prometheus will use to authenticate to the broker's metrics endpoint.

**2. Generate ServiceMonitor YAML:**

Generate the ServiceMonitor configuration for mTLS metrics scraping:

```bash
yarn prometheus-config create-servicemonitor \
  --broker-name my-broker \
  --namespace my-namespace
```

**3. Apply the ServiceMonitor:**

Save the output to a file or pipe directly to kubectl:

```bash
yarn prometheus-config create-servicemonitor \
  --broker-name my-broker \
  --namespace my-namespace | kubectl apply -f -
```

The ServiceMonitor will configure Prometheus to:
- Scrape metrics over HTTPS
- Authenticate using the Prometheus client certificate
- Validate the broker's server certificate using the CA bundle
- Target the broker's metrics endpoint (port 8888)

### Configuration for Non-OpenShift Platforms

The script defaults to OpenShift namespace names, but can be customized using environment variables:

| Environment Variable | Default | Description |
|---------------------|---------|-------------|
| `MONITORING_NAMESPACE` | `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` | Namespace where user workload monitoring pods run |
| `CLUSTER_MONITORING_NAMESPACE` | `openshift-monitoring` | Namespace where cluster monitoring config is stored |
| `MONITORING_CONFIG` | `cluster-monitoring-config` | Name of the ConfigMap that enables monitoring |

**Example for custom platforms:**

```bash
MONITORING_NAMESPACE=monitoring \
CLUSTER_MONITORING_NAMESPACE=kube-monitoring \
MONITORING_CONFIG=monitoring-config \
yarn prometheus-config enable
```

### Manual Configuration

The script applies this ConfigMap:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    enableUserWorkload: true
```

And verifies by checking:

```bash
kubectl -n openshift-user-workload-monitoring get pods
```

## Testing

### Unit tests

```bash
yarn test
```

### E2E Tests with Playwright

This project includes Playwright E2E tests for UI testing and infrastructure validation.

#### UI Tests

With all prerequisites in place and the webpack server running:

1. **Start the Console**: In a second terminal, start the OpenShift console:

   ```bash
   yarn start-console
   ```

2. **Run Tests**: In a third terminal, choose one of the following options:

**Interactive Mode with UI** (recommended for development and debugging):

```bash
KUBEADMIN_PASSWORD=kubeadmin yarn pw:ui
```

Opens Playwright's UI Mode with a visual timeline, DOM snapshots, network inspection, and step-by-step debugging capabilities.

**Headed Mode** (browser visible, without UI):

```bash
KUBEADMIN_PASSWORD=kubeadmin yarn pw:headed
```

Runs tests with a visible browser window but without the interactive debugger.

**Headless Mode** (for CI or quick runs):

```bash
KUBEADMIN_PASSWORD=kubeadmin yarn pw:test
```

Runs tests in the terminal without opening a browser window.

#### Monitoring Tests

The project includes Playwright tests for monitoring (`playwright/e2e/monitoring.spec.ts`). These tests:
1. Enable user workload monitoring via `yarn prometheus-config enable`
2. Verify monitoring is ready via `yarn prometheus-config verify`
3. Verify ServiceMonitor CRD is available (scaffolding for future plugin metrics tests)
4. Clean up by running `yarn prometheus-config disable`

The tests are **skipped by default** (including in CI) to avoid requiring cluster admin permissions and additional resources.

To run the monitoring infrastructure smoke test locally:

```bash
TEST_MONITORING=true KUBEADMIN_PASSWORD=kubeadmin yarn pw:test monitoring
```

#### Certificate Management Tests

The project includes E2E tests for the certificate management workflow:

```bash
# Run all tests (including certificate management)
yarn pw:test

# Run only certificate management tests
yarn pw:test certificate-management
```

These tests validate:
- PKI infrastructure setup
- Certificate creation for BrokerService and BrokerApp
- Resource deployment and readiness
- Cleanup functionality

**Note:** Certificate management tests require:
- cert-manager installed
- trust-manager installed
- ArkMQ operator installed
- Cluster access configured with kubectl
